## **Wrath and Glory Mob Damage**

This is a Foundry VTT module for the Wrath and Glory game system that will assist GMs in calculating casualties suffered by Mobs when they suffer damage from attacks
based on Wrath and Glory's rules. See page 324-325 of the Wrath and Glory Core Rulebook for detailed information.


### **Damage dealt with Psychic Abilities**

The Wrath and Glory Core Rulebook simply states the following regarding damage dealt to Mobs:

*The number of Icons rolled on an attack Test 
determines how many individuals in the Mob are hit. 
Every Icon rolled over the Mobâ€™s Defence means an 
additional individual in the Mob is hit.*

It does not specify which kind of attack tests are applicable and therefore in the absence of any clarification from Cubicle 7 this module has optional functionality which allows damage dealt by Psychic Abilities
to be treated separately to attacks by ordinary damage sources. 

* Multi-target Psychic abilities such as Assail for example will only ever deal one casualty per Mob with a successful attack that deals damage to the Mob.
* Non Multi-target Psychic abilities such as Wall of Flame or Shockwave will be treated as if they are Blast weapons (see 208 of the Core Rulebook) substituting the Willpower of the attacker for the Blast Rating. For example a Willpower of 6 will cause 3 casualties per Mob that is hit.

While this interpretation of the rules does shift the game balance for Psychic abilities it is simply an attempt at balancing abilities which in the absence of guidance from Cubicle 7 range from borderline useless to game-breakingly powerful where Mobs are concerned. This behaviour is optional and is disabled by default so you can decide for yourself if you enjoy this interpretation of the rules or not.

This module is intended to speed up combat involving Mobs and so does not cover all potential sources of damage such as Wrath Criticals/Failures. The players simply roll to hit and roll damage as usual 
and if they hit the module adds a context menu option when right-clicking a weapon/ability test to automatically determine casualties.
