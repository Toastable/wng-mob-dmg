## **Wrath and Glory Mob Damage**

This is a Foundry VTT module for the Wrath and Glory game system that will assist GMs in calculating casualties suffered by Mobs when they suffer damage from attacks
based on Wrath and Glory's rules. See page 324-325 of the Wrath and Glory Core Rulebook for detailed information.


### **Damage dealt with Psychic Abilities**

The Wrath and Glory Core Rulebook simply states the following regarding damage dealt to Mobs:

*The number of Icons rolled on an attack Test 
determines how many individuals in the Mob are hit. 
Every Icon rolled over the Mobâ€™s Defence means an 
additional individual in the Mob is hit.*

It does not specify which kind of attack tests are applicable and therefore in the absence of any clarification from Cubicle 7 this module treats damage dealt by Psychic Abilities
the same as any other attack type such as melee or ranged attacks. While this interpretation of the rules may cause certain notoriously unfair psychic abilities to potentially become more potent that is an
issue with the game system itself and not with the module as such.

This module is intended to speed up combat involving Mobs and so does not cover all potential sources of damage such as Wrath Criticals/Failures. The players simply roll to hit and roll damage as usual 
and if they hit the module adds a context menu option when right-clicking a weapon/ability test to automatically determine casualties.
